## About the pattern
Streaming data is the continuous flow of real-time information, and the foundation of the event-driven architecture software model. Modern applications can use streaming data to enable data processing, storage, and analysis.

Businesses can use this large, fast-moving data sets to build a system that can respond to the data in real-time. This solution pattern deals with building an event streaming platform using Red Hat AMQ Streams based on Apache Kafka to track user activity on an ecomerce website so as to find out the most popular products in the store.
